# castlecloud
Portfolio site

This website is for a fake company called Castle Cloud.

Castle Cloud is a company that rents out bouncy castles in the Phoenix, AZ area. The site is a quick and easy-to-use website that shows a picture of the castle, the price per rental block (5- or 8-hour blocks), and has a link to request the rental for that time.

Time allowing, the site can update in real time, and guests can book and pay for their castle immediately, rather than waiting for a confirmation from a company rep.

The site will include an inventory browse, a way to create an account, an About Us page, and more.

- Push to a branch, not straight to main!
- We approve each other's Merge Requests, I guess?
